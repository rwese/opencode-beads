# Agent Guidelines

## Commands

- **Typecheck**: `bun run typecheck`
- **Install deps**: `bun install`
- No tests configured

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode with ESM modules
- Use `import type` for type-only imports (verbatimModuleSyntax)
- Node.js imports use `node:` prefix (e.g., `node:fs/promises`)
- Handle undefined from indexed access (noUncheckedIndexedAccess enabled)
- camelCase for functions/variables, PascalCase for types/interfaces
- JSDoc comments for function documentation
- Async/await for async operations

## Project Structure

- `src/plugin.ts` - Main plugin entry point

## Notes

- This is an OpenCode plugin integrating the beads issue tracker

## Working with bd Tools

**IMPORTANT**: This project provides bd\_\* MCP tools for issue tracking. All tools are now fully functional and robust:

### Available bd\_\* Tools

- `bd_list` - List issues by status (open, in_progress, blocked, closed)
- `bd_ready` - Find ready-to-work tasks with no blockers
- `bd_stats` - Show project statistics
- `bd_blocked` - Show issues that are blocked by other issues
- `bd_show` - Show detailed information about an issue
- `bd_create` - Create a new issue with optional acceptance criteria and dependencies
- `bd_update` - Update an issue's status, priority, or assignee
- `bd_close` - Close an issue with a reason
- `bd_dep` - Add a dependency between issues
- `bd_sync` - Sync issues with git remote

### Tool Features

- **Robust execution**: Uses absolute path `/Users/wese/.local/bin/bd` to avoid PATH issues
- **Proper error handling**: Detects errors via stderr analysis
- **Data transformation**: Handles field name mismatches between bd and our types
- **Multiple output formats**: Supports json, markdown, and raw output
- **Type safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript types throughout

### Usage Examples

```bash
# List open issues in JSON format
bd_list status="open" format="json"

# Get ready-to-work tasks
bd_ready format="markdown"

# Show project statistics
bd_stats format="json"

# Create a new issue with acceptance criteria
bd_create title="Implement user authentication" type="feature" priority="1" acceptance_criteria='["Users can login with email", "Users can logout", "Sessions expire after 24 hours"]'

# Update issue status
bd_update id="bd-123" status="in_progress"

# Close an issue
bd_close id="bd-123" reason="Completed"
```

## Releasing a New Version

**Triggers**: User says "bump the version", "cut a new release", "release a new version", "let's do a release", or
similar.

### Determining the Version

If the user specifies a version number (e.g., "bump to 0.4.0") or bump type (major/minor/patch), use that. Otherwise:

1. Find the current version in `package.json`
2. Fetch tags from remote: `git fetch origin --tags`
3. Get commits since last release: `git log v<current>..HEAD --oneline`
4. **Read the actual diffs** - don't rely solely on commit messages:
   - `git diff v<current>..HEAD -- src/` for source changes
5. Apply semver:
   - **patch** (0.0.x): Bug fixes, dependency updates
   - **minor** (0.x.0): New features, new commands, non-breaking enhancements
   - **major** (x.0.0): Breaking changes to plugin API or behavior

### Files to Update

1. **`package.json`** - Update `"version"` field
2. **`CHANGELOG.md`**:
   - Move content from `## [Unreleased]` to new version section
   - Add new version heading: `## [X.Y.Z]`
   - Update `[unreleased]` compare link at bottom to compare from new version
   - Add new version release link at the end of the reference links list
3. **`README.md`** - Update version in the installation example JSON

### Commit Convention

Use this exact format:

```
:bookmark: bump version X.Y.Z -> A.B.C
```

### Checklist

- [ ] All three files updated with consistent version
- [ ] CHANGELOG has actual changes listed (not empty)
- [ ] CHANGELOG links point to correct versions
- [ ] Single commit with all version bump changes
- [ ] User will cut the GitHub release after merge

## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other
tracking methods.

### Why bd?

- Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues
- Git-friendly: Auto-syncs to JSONL for version control
- Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links
- Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion

### Quick Start

**Check for ready work:**

```bash
bd ready --json
```

**Create new issues:**

```bash
bd create "Issue title" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Issue title" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json
bd create "Subtask" --parent <epic-id> --json  # Hierarchical subtask (gets ID like epic-id.1)
```

**Claim and update:**

```bash
bd update bd-42 --status in_progress --json
bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json
```

**Complete work:**

```bash
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature with subtasks
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

### Workflow for AI Agents

1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues
2. **Claim your task**: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`
3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document
4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:
   - `bd create "Found bug" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`
5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason "Done"`
6. **Commit together**: Always commit the `.beads/issues.jsonl` file together with the code changes so issue state stays
   in sync with code state

### Writing Self-Contained Issues

Issues must be fully self-contained - readable without any external context (plans, chat history, etc.). A future
session should understand the issue completely from its description alone.

**Required elements:**

- **Summary**: What and why in 1-2 sentences
- **Files to modify**: Exact paths (with line numbers if relevant)
- **Implementation steps**: Numbered, specific actions
- **Example**: Show before → after transformation when applicable

**Optional but helpful:**

- Edge cases or gotchas to watch for
- Test references (point to test files or test_data examples)
- Dependencies on other issues

**Bad example:**

```
Implement the refactoring from the plan
```

**Good example:**

```
Add timeout parameter to fetchUser() in src/api/users.ts

1. Add optional timeout param (default 5000ms)
2. Pass to underlying fetch() call
3. Update tests in src/api/users.test.ts

Example: fetchUser(id) → fetchUser(id, { timeout: 3000 })
Depends on: bd-abc123 (fetch wrapper refactor)
```

### Dependencies: Think "Needs", Not "Before"

`bd dep add X Y` = "X needs Y" = Y blocks X

**TRAP**: Temporal words ("Phase 1", "before", "first") invert your thinking!

```
WRONG: "Phase 1 before Phase 2" → bd dep add phase1 phase2
RIGHT: "Phase 2 needs Phase 1" → bd dep add phase2 phase1
```

**Verify**: `bd blocked` - tasks blocked by prerequisites, not dependents.

### Auto-Sync

bd automatically syncs with git:

- Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)
- Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)
- No manual export/import needed!

### GitHub Copilot Integration

If using GitHub Copilot, also create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for automatic instruction loading. Run
`bd onboard` to get the content, or see step 2 of the onboard instructions.

### MCP Server (Recommended)

If using Claude or MCP-compatible clients, install the beads MCP server:

```bash
pip install beads-mcp
```

Add to MCP config (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):

```json
{
  "beads": {
    "command": "beads-mcp",
    "args": []
  }
}
```

Then use `mcp__beads__*` functions instead of CLI commands.

### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents

AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:

- PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md
- DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md
- TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files

**Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**

**Recommended approach:**

- Create a `history/` directory in the project root
- Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`
- Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files
- Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning

**Example .gitignore entry (optional):**

```
# AI planning documents (ephemeral)
history/
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Clean repository root
- ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation
- ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired
- ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research
- ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project

### CLI Help

Run `bd <command> --help` to see all available flags for any command. For example: `bd create --help` shows `--parent`,
`--deps`, `--assignee`, etc.

### Important Rules

- ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking
- ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use
- ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies
- ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking "what should I work on?"
- ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory
- ✅ Run `bd <cmd> --help` to discover available flags
- ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists
- ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers
- ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems
- ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents

For more details, see README.md and QUICKSTART.md.

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**

- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
